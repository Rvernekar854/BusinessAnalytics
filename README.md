# BusinessAnalytics Sales Pridiction Model
In this Model, Data has been fit through Linear regression, Exponential, Logarithmic, Quadratic and Cubic model. Using these statistical model,
the data goes through the testing phase and respective Root Mean Squared Error value are calculated.The Cubic and seemed better performing and
Exponential model was worst performing model for given data set. 

In the model fitting phase the Cubic Model had the least Root Mean Squared Error value where as during the predicting phase the  Quadratic Model performed better than Cubic model.
The RMSE error metric value has increased by many folds during the prediction phase when compared to fitting phase. The Model performed worse with prediction when compared to
fitting .
This is because of the increase in the gap between the actual sales and predicted values from the model. This diffrence in majorly observed in sales value of year 2019
and 2020. These model were bit under fitted compared to the growth rate of sales in 2019 and 2020.

But the relative performance among these model remaind the same expect for Cubic and Quadratic model. This referenced from the Rank table for Fiiting and Predicting.
